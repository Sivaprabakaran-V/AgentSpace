Renowned for his vision, passing, and composure, he began his career at Dinamo Zagreb, moved to Tottenham Hotspur in 2008, and joined Real Madrid in 2012, where he became a pivotal figure in winning multiple UEFA Champions League and La Liga titles. He led Croatia to the 2018 FIFA World Cup final, winning the Golden Ball, and that same year claimed the Ballon d’Or, breaking the Messi–Ronaldo dominance. His leadership, work rate, and technical mastery have kept him performing at the highest level well into his late 30s."""
